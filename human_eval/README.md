# Human Evaluations of Generated Images

We conduct detailed human evaluations on a subset of images generated by different methods. If you're interested in exploring these images and their associated data, follow the instructions and information provided below.

## Accessing the Generated Images
You can download a sample of 120 generated images for evaluation from the following link: [Download Generated Images](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Prm1cJRiOMSOEVF3H6-rIfWyZbsMASN/view?usp=sharing). Please unzip the file in this folder for the following analysis.

Alongside each image, we provide:

- Detailed prompts used for generating and evaluting the image
- Human evaluation scores for composition and image quality
- CLIPScore for each image
- Scores on composition and image quality based on GPT-4V evaluations

All the detailed information is available in `results.json`.

## Evaluation Results by Method
We evaluate the images generated by different methods using several metrics. Here are the summarized results:
```
+-----------+-------------------+-------------+-----------+-------------------+-------------+
|  Methods  | Human-Composition | Human-Image | CLIPScore | GPT4V-Composition | GPT4V-Image |
+-----------+-------------------+-------------+-----------+-------------------+-------------+
|   merge   |        3.14       |     2.94    |   33.42   |        7.02       |     9.24    |
|   switch  |        3.91       |     4.15    |   35.52   |        7.22       |     9.53    |
| composite |        3.77       |     4.35    |   34.85   |        7.13       |     9.55    |

```

## Correlations Between Metrics and Human Judgements
To further understand the effectiveness of each metric, we calculate their correlations with human judgements. The correlation scores are as follows:
```
+-----------------------------------------+---------+----------+---------+
|                 Metrics                 | Pearson | Spearman | Kendall |
+-----------------------------------------+---------+----------+---------+
|     CLIPScore --- Human Composition     |  -0.006 |  0.024   |  0.019  |
|    CLIPScore --- Human Image Quliaty    |  0.083  |   0.08   |  0.055  |
| GPT4V Composition --- Human Composition |  0.454  |  0.449   |  0.337  |
|       GPT4V Image --- Human Image       |  0.457  |  0.426   |  0.337  |
+-----------------------------------------+---------+----------+---------+
